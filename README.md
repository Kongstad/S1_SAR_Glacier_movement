# Sentinel-1 SAR data to visualize glacial movement
Using Sentinel-1 SAR GRD data to visualize glacial movement on Eastern Greenland via SNAP and Google Earth Pro. This repository does not contain any python code and is rather a demonstration of the retrieval and usage of SAR data to visualize iceflow. It generally covers the overarching steps, but is by no means a step by step guide. 
This effort has been completed thanks to the tutorials from: https://asf.alaska.edu/

## Background

In this project, Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected products will be used together with offset tracking to quantify the movement between two images, i.e. glacial movement over a period of 12 days. In this case I have targetted glaciers North West of the city of Ittoqqortoormiit (Scoresbysund) on North Eastern Greenland ([Google Earth link](https://www.google.com/maps/@71.1214979,-26.1528196,302840m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4))

The images I have found on Copernicus Sci Hub and have the following names:
 * S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDH_20220812T083752_20220812T083817_044517_055004_D3C2
 * S1A_IW_GRDH_1SDH_20220824T083752_20220824T083817_044692_0555F5_334B

As seen in the name they are from the 12th and 24th of August 2022. This is during summer in the Northern Hemisphere and the period where we are likely to see the most glacial melting taking place.
