# Sentinel-1 SAR data to visualize glacial movement
Using Sentinel-1 SAR GRD data to visualize glacial movement on Eastern Greenland via SNAP and Google Earth Pro. This repository does not contain any python code and is rather a demonstration of the retrieval and usage of SAR data to visualize iceflow. It generally covers the overarching steps, but is by no means a step by step guide. 
This effort has been guided by tutorials from: https://asf.alaska.edu/
